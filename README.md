What is this TACTIC?
TACTIC â€“ it's something! Go here if you don't know [TACTIC Opensourse](https://github.com/listyque/TACTIC)
Basically it is powerful asset management system, primarily for CG, but can be aciquired to any kind of your business needs. Thanks to its powerful customization ability.
Then what TACTIC Handler?
Yup, may be you don't need this either, if you already using TACTIC. But if you don't this tool can handle you in some cases. 
Because TACTIC is client-server system, and work with the Web, and your browser (which make it runnable basically on everything), not so comfortable to use it with your favorite content making apps, like Maya, 3dsmax, or something similar. TACTIC Handler gives you ability to use BASIC functions of TACTIC, without leaving your favorite app. You can spend some time to set up TACTIC and then TACTIC Handler for you, and can have big amount of time saved.
